                <img id="striped-image" src="../assets/images/2.jpeg"/>
                <p>The design is based on the most representative Song dynasty porcelain as a point of inspiration, and the pattern is generated by analysing and studying its colour pattern and surface texture .
                    I hope that through my work,people will learn more about Chinese porcelain and appreciate the beauty of Chinese porcelain. </p>
